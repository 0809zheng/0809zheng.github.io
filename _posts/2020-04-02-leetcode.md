## 题目
According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.

Example:
```
Input: 
[
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 
[
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,0]
]
```

## 思路
细胞的存活状态(0/1)由其八个相邻位置（水平，垂直，对角线）的细胞存活状态决定，使用二维数组的卷积操作实现。

对原数组进行zero padding后使用如下卷积核(kernel)判断中心位置的细胞存活情况：

$$ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \end{bmatrix} $$

## 解答
```
class Solution:
    def gameOfLife(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> None:
	
        """
        Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
		
        import numpy as np

        m, n = len(board), len(board[0])
        board_pad = np.pad(np.array(board), ((1, 1), (1, 1)), 'constant')

        kernel = np.array([[1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1]])

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                seed = np.sum(board_pad[i:i+3, j:j+3]*kernel)
                if board[i][j] == 1:
                    if seed < 2 or seed >3:
                        board[i][j] = 0
                else:
                    if board[i][j] == 0 and seed == 3:
                        board[i][j] = 1
```

## 补充
Cellular Automaton(元胞自动机)是一种不间断的演化过程，动画演示参考[这里](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~zzzz/lifegame/lifegame.html)。

有趣的是在演化过程中会重复出现固定的pattern，详情可以查看[这里](https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Main_Page)。
