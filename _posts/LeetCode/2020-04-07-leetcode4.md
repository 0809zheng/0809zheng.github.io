## 题目
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Example 1：**
```
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

**Example 2：**
```
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3：**
```
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

## 解答
```
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        if s == '':
            return 0
        length = 1

        for i in range(len(s)-1):
            str, count = s[i], 1
            for j in range(i+1, len(s)):
                if s[j] in str:
                    break
                count += 1
                str += s[j]
            if count > length:
                length = count
        
        return length
```
