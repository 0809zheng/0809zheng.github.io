> LeetCode 每日一题 #983.[Minimum Cost For Tickets](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/minimum-cost-for-tickets/)

## 题目
In a country popular for train travel, you have planned some train travelling one year in advance.  The days of the year that you will travel is given as an array days.  Each day is an integer from 1 to 365.

Train tickets are sold in 3 different ways:

- a 1-day pass is sold for $$costs[0]$$ dollars;
- a 7-day pass is sold for $$costs[1]$$ dollars;
- a 30-day pass is sold for $$costs[2]$$ dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.  For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.


**Example 1：**
```
Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 11
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.
```

**Example 2：**
```
Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 17
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
In total you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.
```

**Note：**
1. $$1 <= days.length <= 365$$
2. $$1 <= days[i] <= 365$$
3. days is in strictly increasing order.
4. $$costs.length == 3$$
5. $$1 <= costs[i] <= 1000$$



## 思路
动态规划：

- **状态定义：**

$dp\[i\]$:从第$i$天开始到一年结束的最小花费。

- **转移方程：**

如果第$i$天有出行计划：

$$ dp[i] = min(dp[i+1]+costs[0], dp[i+7]+costs[1], dp[i+30]+costs[2]) $$

如果第$i$天没有出行计划：

$$ dp[i] = dp[i+1] $$

- **初始状态：**

$dp$所有元素赋值为0，长度设置为$1+365+30$。

- **返回值：**

返回$$dp[1]$$。

## 解答
```
class Solution:
    def mincostTickets(self, days: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [0]*396
        for i in range(365, 0, -1):
            if i in days:
                dp[i] = float('inf')
                for j, d in enumerate([1, 7, 30]):
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i+d]+costs[j])
            else:
                dp[i] = dp[i+1]
        return dp[1]
```
