> LeetCode 每日一题 #695.[Max Area of Island](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/max-area-of-island/)

## 题目
Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.)

**Example 1：**

```
[[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
```
Given the above grid, return 6. Note the answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

**Example 2：**

```
[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
```
Given the above grid, return 0.

**Note：**

The length of each dimension in the given grid does not exceed 50.

## 思路
深度优先搜索：对于每一个为1的元素，计数器加1后元素置零，并搜索上下左右的相邻元素。

## 解答
```
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        area = 0
                
        def dfs(i, j):
            if grid[i][j] == 0:
                return 0
            self.count += 1
            grid[i][j] = 0
            if i>0:
                dfs(i-1, j)
            if i<m-1:
                dfs(i+1, j)
            if j>0:
                dfs(i, j-1)
            if j<n-1:
                dfs(i, j+1)
            return self.count
    
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    self.count = 0
                    area = max(area, dfs(i, j))

        return area
```
