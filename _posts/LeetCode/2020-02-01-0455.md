> LeetCode 每日一题 #455.[Assign Cookies](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/assign-cookies/)

## 题目
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

**Note：**
You may assume the greed factor is always positive.

You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.

**Example 1：**
```
Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]

Output: 1

Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
```

**Example 2：**
```
Input: [1,2], [1,2,3]

Output: 2

Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.
```

## 思路
双指针

## 解答
```
class Solution:
    def findContentChildren(self, g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:
        g.sort()
        s.sort()
        i, j, count = 0, 0, 0
        while i<len(g) and j<len(s):
            if g[i]<=s[j]:
                count += 1
                i += 1
            j += 1
        return count
```

## 复杂度
- 时间复杂度：$O(mlog(m)+nlog(n))$
- 空间复杂度：$O(1)$
