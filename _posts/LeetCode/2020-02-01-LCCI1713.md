> LeetCode 每日一题 #面试题 17.13. [Re-Space LCCI](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/re-space-lcci/)

## 题目
Oh, no! You have accidentally removed all spaces, punctuation, and capitalization in a lengthy document. A sentence like "I reset the computer. It still didn't boot!" became "iresetthecomputeritstilldidntboot''. You'll deal with the punctuation and capi­talization later; right now you need to re-insert the spaces. Most of the words are in a dictionary but a few are not. Given a dictionary (a list of strings) and the document (a string), design an algorithm to unconcatenate the document in a way that minimizes the number of unrecognized characters. Return the number of unrecognized characters.

**Note:** This problem is slightly different from the original one in the book.

**Example:**
```
Input: 
dictionary = ["looked","just","like","her","brother"]
sentence = "jesslookedjustliketimherbrother"
Output:  7
Explanation:  After unconcatenating, we got "jess looked just like tim her brother", which containing 7 unrecognized characters.
```
**Note:**
- 0 <= len(sentence) <= 1000
- The total number of characters in dictionary is less than or equal to 150000.
- There are only lowercase letters in dictionary and sentence.


## 思路
动态规划：

- **状态定义：**

$dp\[i\]$:表示句子中前$i$个字符串的多余长度。

- **转移方程：**

默认字典中不存在以$i$个字符解尾的单词，则：

$$ dp[i] = dp[i-1]+1 $$

遍历字典中的每一个单词$k$，当字符串$$s[i-len(k):i]$$恰好是单词$k$时：

$$ dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-len(k)]) $$

- **初始状态：**

$dp$所有元素赋值为0。

- **返回值：**

返回$dp\[n\]$。

## 解答
```
class Solution:
    def respace(self, dictionary: List[str], sentence: str) -> int:
        d = {}
        for k in dictionary:
            d[k] = len(k)
            
        n = len(sentence)
        dp = [0]*(n+1)

        for i in range(1, n+1):
            dp[i] = dp[i-1]+1
            for k in dictionary:
                if i - d[k] >= 0 and sentence[i-d[k]:i] == k:
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-d[k]])

        return dp[n]
```

## 复杂度
- 时间复杂度：$O(mn)$
- 空间复杂度：$O(min(m,n))$
