> LeetCode 每日一题 #198.[House Robber](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/house-robber/)

## 题目
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.


**Example 1：**
```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 2：**
```
Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```


## 思路
动态规划：

- **状态定义：**

$dp\[i\]$:从前$i$个商店中能获取的最大金额。

- **转移方程：**

如果光顾第$i-1$家商店，则不能光顾第$i$家商店：

$$ dp[i] = max(dp[i-2]+nums[i], dp[i-1]) $$

- **初始状态：**

$dp$所有元素赋值为0。

- **返回值：**

返回$$dp[-1]$$。

## 解答
```
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [0]*(n+2)
        for i in range(n):
            dp[i+2] = max(dp[i]+nums[i], dp[i+1])
        return dp[-1]
```

## 复杂度
- 时间复杂度：$O(n)$
- 空间复杂度：$O(n)$
