> LeetCode 每日一题 #225.[Implement Stack using Queues](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/)

## 题目
Implement the following operations of a stack using queues.

- ```push(x)``` -- Push element x onto stack.
- ```pop()``` -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
- ```top()``` -- Get the top element.
- ```empty()``` -- Return whether the stack is empty.

**Example：**

```
MyStack stack = new MyStack();

stack.push(1);
stack.push(2);  
stack.top();   // returns 2
stack.pop();   // returns 2
stack.empty(); // returns false
```

**Notes:**

- You must use only standard operations of a queue -- which means only push to back, peek/pop from front, size, and is empty operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a queue.
- You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or top operations will be called on an empty stack).

## 解答
```
class MyStack:

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.stack = []


    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        """
        Push element x onto stack.
        """
        self.stack.append(x)


    def pop(self) -> int:
        """
        Removes the element on top of the stack and returns that element.
        """
        return self.stack.pop(-1)


    def top(self) -> int:
        """
        Get the top element.
        """
        return self.stack[-1]


    def empty(self) -> bool:
        """
        Returns whether the stack is empty.
        """
        return self.stack == []


# Your MyStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyStack()
# obj.push(x)
# param_2 = obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.top()
# param_4 = obj.empty()
```
