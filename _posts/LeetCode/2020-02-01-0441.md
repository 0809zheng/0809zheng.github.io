> LeetCode 每日一题 #441.[Arranging Coins](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/arranging-coins/)

## 题目
You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of **full** staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.


**Example 1：**
```
n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```

**Example 2：**
```
n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```

## 思路
设共有$n$个硬币，可以完整的排列$c$列：

$$ \frac{c(c+1)}{2} ≤ n $$

求解$c$：

$$ c = \frac{-1+ \sqrt{1+8n}}{2} $$

## 解答
```
class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:
        return int((-1+math.sqrt(1+8*n))/2)
```

## 复杂度
- 时间复杂度：$O(1)$
- 空间复杂度：$O(1)$
