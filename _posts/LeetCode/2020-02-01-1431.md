> LeetCode 每日一题 #1431.[Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/kids-with-the-greatest-number-of-candies/)

## 题目
Given the array candies and the integer extraCandies, where candies[i] represents the number of candies that the **ith** kid has.

For each kid check if there is a way to distribute extraCandies among the kids such that he or she can have the **greatest** number of candies among them. Notice that multiple kids can have the **greatest** number of candies.


**Example 1：**
```
Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
Explanation: 
Kid 1 has 2 candies and if he or she receives all extra candies (3) will have 5 candies --- the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 2 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 3 has 5 candies and this is already the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 4 has 1 candy and even if he or she receives all extra candies will only have 4 candies. 
Kid 5 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
```

**Example 2：**
```
Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
Output: [true,false,false,false,false] 
Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy, therefore only kid 1 will have the greatest number of candies among the kids regardless of who takes the extra candy.
```

**Example 3：**
```
Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
Output: [true,false,true]
```

**Note：**
1. 2 <= candies.length <= 100
2. 1 <= candies[i] <= 100
3. 1 <= extraCandies <= 50

## 思路
枚举法。

## 解答
```
class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:
        maxcandies = max(candies)
        return [c+extraCandies >= maxcandies for c in candies]
```
