## 题目
At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $ \$ $5. 

Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you, and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills).

Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a 5, 10, or 20 bill.  You must provide the correct change to each customer, so that the net transaction is that the customer pays 5.

Note that you don't have any change in hand at first.

Return true if and only if you can provide every customer with correct change.


**Example 1：**
```
Input: [5,5,5,10,20]
Output: true
Explanation: 
From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
Since all customers got correct change, we output true.
```

**Example 2：**
```
Input: [5,5,10]
Output: true
```

**Example 3：**
```
Input: [10,10]
Output: false
```

**Example 4：**
```
Input: [5,5,10,10,20]
Output: false
Explanation: 
From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.
For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.
For the last customer, we can't give change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.
Since not every customer received correct change, the answer is false.
```

**Note：**
- 0 <= bills.length <= 10000
- bills[i] will be either 5, 10, or 20.

## 思路
对于5元，5元数量加一；

对于10元，10元数量加一，5元数量减一；

对于20元，有10元优先找10元，否则找5元。

## 解答
```
class Solution:
    def lemonadeChange(self, bills: List[int]) -> bool:
        change = {5:0, 10:0}
        for b in bills:
            if b == 5:
                change[5] += 1
            elif b == 10:
                if change[5] > 0:
                    change[10] += 1
                    change[5] -= 1
                else:
                    return False
            else:
                if change[5] > 0 and change[10] > 0:
                    change[10] -= 1
                    change[5] -= 1
                elif change[5] > 2:
                    change[5] -= 3
                else:
                    return False
        return True
```
