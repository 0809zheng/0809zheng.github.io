## 题目
Given a string **s** and a string **t**, check if **s** is subsequence of **t**.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).


**Example 1：**
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

**Example 2：**
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```


**Constraints:**
- `0 <= s.length <= 100`
- `0 <= t.length <= 10^4`
- Both strings consists only of lowercase characters.


## 思路
使用指针和循环进行匹配。

## 解答
```
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if s == '':
            return True

        m, n = len(s), len(t)
        cursor = 0

        for i in range(n):
            if s[cursor] == t[i]:
                cursor += 1
                if cursor >= m:
                    return True
                    
        return False
```

## 复杂度
- 时间复杂度：$O(max(m,n))$
- 空间复杂度：$O(1)$
