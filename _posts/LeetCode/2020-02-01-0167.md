> LeetCode 每日一题 #167.[Two Sum II - Input array is sorted](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)

## 题目
Given an array of integers that is already **sorted in ascending order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

**Note:**
- Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.

**Example：**
```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

## 思路
二分法。

## 解答
```
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        n = len(numbers)
        for i in range(n-1):
            num = target - numbers[i]
            l, r = i+1, n-1
            while l<=r:
                m = (l+r)//2
                if numbers[m] == num:
                    return [i+1, m+1]
                if numbers[m] < num:
                    l = m+1
                else:
                    r = m-1
```

## 复杂度
- 时间复杂度：$O(nlogn)$
- 空间复杂度：$O(1)$
