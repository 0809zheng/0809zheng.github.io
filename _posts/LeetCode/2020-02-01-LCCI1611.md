> LeetCode 每日一题 #面试题 16.11. [Diving Board LCCI](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/diving-board-lcci/)

## 题目
You are building a diving board by placing a bunch of planks of wood end-to-end. There are two types of planks, one of length shorter and one of length longer. You must use exactly K planks of wood. Write a method to generate all possible lengths for the diving board.

return all lengths in non-decreasing order.

**Example:**
```
Input: 
shorter = 1
longer = 2
k = 3
Output:  {3,4,5,6}
```

**Note:**
- 0 < shorter <= longer
- 0 <= k <= 100000


## 思路
使用列表生成式实现。

## 解答
```
class Solution:
    def divingBoard(self, shorter: int, longer: int, k: int) -> List[int]:
        if k == 0:
            return []
        if shorter == longer:
            return [shorter*k]
        return [(k-i)*shorter+i*longer for i in range(k+1)]
```

## 复杂度
- 时间复杂度：$O(n)$
- 空间复杂度：$O(n)$
